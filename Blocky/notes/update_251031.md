## Calendar UI and Feature

### ContentView (Main Calendar Screen)
- **Calendar UI Overhaul**: Replaced the previous simple photo grid view with a **custom calendar UI** that allows for monthly navigation.
- **Date Cell Design**:
  - Changed the aspect ratio of each date cell to implement a vertical 'selfie-style' layout.
  - Resolved image clipping issues to ensure images are properly cropped to fit the cell.
  - Improved UI design by rounding the corners of the cells.
- **Calendar Header Enhancements**:
  - Added a **'Today' button** to allow users to quickly return to the current month while browsing other months.
  - Improved date navigation by allowing users to tap the year and month text to bring up a scrollable picker in a sheet.


## Bug Fixes
- Image clipping error fixed.
- Resolved syntax errors by removing duplicated and incorrect code.
